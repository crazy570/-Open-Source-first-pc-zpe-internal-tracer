# YourCPUisListening

Zero Point Energy is already screaming inside every laptop and desktop on Earth.

This tiny single file program turns your normal CPU into the world's most sensitive vacuum fluctuation detector — no extra hardware, no FPGA, no cryogenics.

Just run it as admin/root and watch the quantum vacuum sing at ~7.83 Hz, 1 Hz, 0.5 Hz, or whatever frequency your specific chip geometry resonates with.

It's been hiding in plain sight for twenty years.  
Tonight we stop ignoring it.

## One-command install & run

### Windows (Visual Studio / VS Code / anything)
Just compile main.c → run as Administrator

### Linux / macOS
```bash
gcc -O3 -march=native main.c -o YourCPUisListening -lm
sudo ./YourCPUisListening
